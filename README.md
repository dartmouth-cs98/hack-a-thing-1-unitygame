## What I built 

I followed a [10 part video series tutorial] (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter/environment?playlist=17144) created by Unity called Survival Shooter to create this game. This game is a shooter style game where the player is dreaming about zombie toys that it has to shoot and avoid to stay alive. Every few seconds new enemies will spawn and the player can gain health by shooting them. If the enemies touch the player, he/she loses health and when the health goes to 0 the player dies. 

## What I learned

I've never worked in Unity before so most of what I had to do was new to me. I learned about a lot of various functions of Unity such as setting up players, creating objects and prefabs, positioning them on the screen, attaching scripts to various actions and spawning characters at a set time and place. 
## What didn't work

Since the tutorial was created for Unity 4 but the latest version of Unity (which I used) was Unity 5, a few of the instructions didn't line up correctly since things had changed in version 5. It took a little bit more exploring to figure out where the new feature controls were or if there were parts of the scripts that needed to be changed.
